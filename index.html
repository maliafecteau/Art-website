				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Hello.  <br> I am Malia Fecteau, a year 13 student at Naenae College.  Art has been a way to channel and challenge my creativity and imagination for many years of my life.  <br>  I have done art class for all my years at school, but this year I decided to challenge myself.  <br>The old masters of painting: Leonardo Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Caravaggio, Vermeer, they all inspired me this year in the style of my painting.  This meant that I would be painting in oils this year, and trying to apply techniques from these great artists, along with impressionist artists such as Degas, Manet, Renoir, Pissarro, and Monet.  The difference is, however, I will be painting modern scenes, and surreal scenes, to go along with my theme:  Feminism. <br> <br> Ever since I was young, I have had feminism drilled into me by my mother; the importance of it, what it truly is, and everything in the world that shows just how much we need it.  For that, I thank her endlessly.  Feminism is a part of me, and it has become a huge force in my recent journey of self-discovery.  I have realised that, no matter how I identify, what I feel like or look like or do, I am female, and <em>nothing</em> can take that away.  It is something to be proud of, something to hold on to, and something that can mean anything.  <br>  With my board this year, rather than the aggressive side that people tend to think of when they picture "Feminism", I want to simply display the "Female experience", or what it is like to live in this world as a female.  Although this is based on my own experience and others I know, I hope that other women can understand the feelings that I am trying to depict, and that people without these experiences can gain insight into how it really is living as a female.<br></p>
